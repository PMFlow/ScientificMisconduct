Zeyuan Song and Zheyu Jiang from Oklahoma State University (USA) published tree articles based on [Suciu et al., 2021] (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2021.103935) 
and the accompanying Git-repository https://github.com/PMFlow/RichardsEquation, containing the Matlab codes used in [Suciu et al., 2021].

The first author of the above article sent on 16/02/2024 a report on scientific misconduct to the Etics Point of Oklahoma State University (see EthicsPoint_report.pdf). 
The university has not taken a position regarding this report, there was no feedback at all, and in mean time the report is closed without any questions and comments 
(see EthicsPoint_closed.pdf).

The elements of scientific misconduct, such as Plagiarism, Falsification, and Fabrication identified in the three articles published by Song and Jiang are presented in 
the red-color comments made on Paper1, Paper2, and Paper3 and demonstrated with associated Matlab codes.
