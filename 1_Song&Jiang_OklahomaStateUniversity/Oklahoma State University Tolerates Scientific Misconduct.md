A) FACTS presented in the repository https://github.com/PMFlow/ScientificMisconduct/tree/main/1_Song%26Jiang_OklahomaStateUniversity and mentioned in the two reports submitted to EthicsPoint | Oklahoma State University – a selection among many other elements of scientific misconduct.
1. Plagiarism: use of published results and data files without giving appropriate credit (see red comment #3 on page 5 and red comment #3 on page 4 in "Paper1-commented.pdf", as well as the demonstration of falsifying the initial condition in order to hide the plagiarism in "Song&Jiang_falsification_IC_Paper1").
2. Fabrication of results (see red comment #13 on page 5 in "Paper2-commented.pdf" and the demonstration that the 3-dimensional results are in fact fabricated with a 2-dimensional code already published in the literature in "Song&Jiang_fabricated_IC_Paper2").
3. Falsification of results produced by codes published in the literature (see red comment #4 and yellow comment #6 on page 3 in Paper1-commented.pdf, red comment #4 on page 14 in "Paper3-commented.pdf" and the demonstration of the false statement that the relation between the pressure head solution and the number of particles “is neither smooth nor explicit” in "Song&Jiang_falsification_GRWvsFD_Paper3").

B) COMMUNNICATION from EthicsPoint | Oklahoma State University (https://hr.okstate.edu/ethics-point.html)

“… the allegation does not meet the definition of research misconduct under University Policy 4-0125. This determination was made because the issues presented in the allegations are a matter of differences in scientific opinions, rather than research misconduct.”
#
C) DEFINITIONS from University Policy 4-0125 (https://adminfinance.okstate.edu/site-files/documents/policies/complaints-of-research-misconduct.pdf)

2.03 “Fabrication” means making up data or results and recording or reporting them.

2.04 “Falsification” means manipulating research materials, equipment or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.

2.07 “Plagiarism” means the appropriation of another person’s ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.

2.09 “Research Misconduct” means fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other practices which seriously deviate from those commonly accepted within the scholarly community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research. It does not include honest errors or differences in opinion.
#
D) CONCLUSION:
Since the facts presented at item A) above, demonstrated and verifiable, match the definitions from item C), they cannot be qualified as “differences in scientific opinions”. Closing the report on scientific misconduct based on the obviously superficial and incorrect conclusion of the preliminary review (item B above), Oklahoma State University tolerates the scientific misconduct consisting of plagiarism, fabrication, and falsification.
